= Developer Experience

== Goals

To deploy and configure an application, leverage the platform for monitoring & management of the microservices, and automate a continuous delivery pipeline.

== Exercises

=== Console

Before we do anything lets take a look at the developer console and confirm install of the Cloud Foundry CLI on our laptops/desktops. 

* link:http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/console/dev-console.html[User Console Docs]

* login to the console at https://console.run.pcf.jkruckcloud.com
* We use self signed certs, go through that little dance in your browser. 
* If you're using chrome, make sure it's a recent. Folks from THD have had some issues with an older version 
* Login with your THD email and a password of `password`
* Navigate to "Tools" (Left side)
* Download and install the CLI for your platform.
* Note theres some minimal instructions about what you'll do next given to you in the console. 

=== CLI
Now that we have the CLI, lets push some basic applications quickly and navigate our way around the CLI. 

* Login to Cloud Foundry

`cf login -a https://api.run.pcf.jkruckcloud.com -u <your email> -p password`

. `-a` is the api we're targeting. Meaning all actions we perform will take place on this Cloud Foundry Foundation (deployment)

. `-u` is your username, in this workshop it's your email address.

. `-p` is your password. I've set it to password

=== Pushing apps
* Clone our example applications

`git clone https://github.com/krujos/cf-hello-world-sample-apps`

`cd cf-hello-world-sample-apps`

Read `README.md` and push some apps!!

== More Exercises

Now we're going to switch to a java application called `cities`. We will use this application for the remainder of the workshop.

The `pcf-immersion-workshop` project you forked has a directory called `cities` we will use for this section.

* Review the Keynote on link:Cloud_Ready_Apps.key[Cloud Ready Apps]

* Review the link:https://github.com/pcf-alliances-immersion/pcf-immersion-workspace/tree/master/cities[overview] of the `cities` repository.  It is important to understand the components of this project as we will use them throughout the remainder of the class.

== Verifying our setup 

. login to the console at https://console.run.pcf.jkruckcloud.comoh
